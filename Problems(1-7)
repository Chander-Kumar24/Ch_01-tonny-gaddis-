"""1. Bug Collector
A bug collector collects bugs every day for five days. Write a program that keeps a running 
total of the number of bugs collected during the five days. The loop should ask for the 
number of bugs collected for each day, and when the loop is finished, the program should 
display the total number of bugs collected."""
